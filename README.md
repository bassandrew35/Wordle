# Wordle
A helper tool for Wordle that shows all valid guesses.

## Guide:
1. Open https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html and guess your first word.
2. Run WordleV2.py and follow the instructions in the command line.
3. Beat Wordle!

### WordleV2.py tips:
For green and grey characters you only need to enter them once. For yellow characters you need to enter them for each guess.

If you enter something in wrong and the code exits just restart the code and you can enter in all your guesses in one go.
